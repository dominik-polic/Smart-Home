# Smart-Home
This is a repository containg old version of Aarduino and Raspberry Pi programs I previously used in my home automation system. 

The Android App is still updated, and it's open source, but it's also available on [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.no_ip.wqwdpxd.homeautomationwear_php), but only for my personal use currently. 

The rest of the code for my smart home project can be found in the [new repository](https://github.com/wqwdpxd/Smart-Home-MQTT)
